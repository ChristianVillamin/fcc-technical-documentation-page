            At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements,
            which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different
            meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is
            it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections
            (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation
            menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.
            This module will introduce the first two of these, and introduce
            fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML
            knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using
            computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and
            consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up
            (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to
            create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both
            are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's
            module.

            let you create your own files, you can try out (most of) the code

            In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML, to get you
            started. We define elements, attributes, and all the other important
            terms you may have heard, and where they fit into the language. We
            also show how an HTML element is structured, how a typical HTML page
            is structured, and explain other important basic language features.
            Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!
          </p>

          <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
          <p>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it
            is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the
            web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the
            web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of
            elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts
            of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing
            tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another
            page on the web, italicize words, and so on. For example, take the
            following line of content:
          </p>

          <code>My cat is a grumpy one!</code>

          <p>
            If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it
            is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph &lt;p&gt; element.
          </p>

          <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is a grumpy one!&lt;p&gt;</code>

          <ol>
            <li>i2</li>

            One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also
            known as semantics) so that a browser can display it correctly. This
            article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of
            text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating
            lists, and more.

            Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the Web a web.
            This article shows the syntax required to make a link, and discusses
            link best practices.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to
            offer. Well, they've been a feature of the Web since the very
            beginning, but they are what makes the Web a Web — they allow us to
            link our documents to any other document (or other resource) we want
            to, we can also link to specific parts of documents, and we can make
            apps available at a simple web address (contrast this to native
            apps, which have to be installed and all that business.) Just about
            any web content can be converted to a link, so that when clicked (or
            otherwise activated) it will make the web browser go to another web
            address (URL).
          </p>

          <code>&lt;a href="YOUR_LINK"&gt;LINK_TITLE&lt;/a&gt;</code>

          <p>For example, I will create a link to the Mozilla homepage</p>

          <code
            >&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org"&gt;Mozilla
            Homepage&lt;/a&gt;</code
          >
          <p>Result:</p>
          <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla Homepage</a>

            Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you
            can't work out where the error in the code is? This article will

          <h1>Debugging isn't scary</h1>
          <p>
            When writing code of some kind, everything is usually fine, until
            that dreaded moment when an error occurs — you've done something
            wrong, so your code doesn't work — either not at all, or not quite
            how you wanted it to. For example, the following shows an error
            reported when trying to compile a simple program written in the Rust
            language.
          </p>

          <p>You can use the console log in JavaScript to debug. Example:</p>
          <code>console.log(error)</code>

            In the beginning, the Web was just text, and it was really quite
            boring. Fortunately, it wasn't too long before the ability to embed
            images (and other more interesting types of content) inside web
            pages was added. There are other types of multimedia to consider,
            but it is logical to start with the humble &lt;img&gt; element, used
            to embed a simple image in a webpage. In this article we'll look at
            how to use it in depth, including the basics, annotating it with
            captions using &lt;figure&gt;, and detailing how it relates to CSS
            background images.
          </p>
          <h1>How do we put an image on a webpage?</h1>
          <p>
            In order to put a simple image on a webpage, we use the &lt;img&gt;
            element. This is an empty element (meaning that it has no text
            content or closing tag) that requires a minimum of one attribute to
            be useful — src (sometimes spoken as its full title, source). The
            src attribute contains a path pointing to the image you want to
            embed in the page, which can be a relative or absolute URL, in the
            same way as &lt;a&gt; element href attribute values.
          </p>

          <p>
            So for example, if your image is called dinosaur.jpg, and it sits in
            the same directory as your HTML page, you could embed the image like
            so:
          </p>
          <code>&lt;img&gt; src="dinosaur.jpg"/&gt;</code>
